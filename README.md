# Background Changer

This is a simple python program that calls the Unsplash API. The program provides users with a interface where they may choose a random picture, search by a term, or by a collection found on the unsplash website. Once an option is chosen, the program will automatically update their background with an image accordingly. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites - Unsplash Account

First you'll need to create an account with Unsplash. It is easy and free, just visit their website at:
